Below is a guide explaining out-of-order processors and some details on Tomasulo's Algorithm and Explicit Register Renaming.

## Why Out-of-Order?

Out-of-order architectures are popular for high-performance CPU architectures. They reduce performance penalties due to false dependencies between nearby instructions.

For example, consider the following simple program:

```
1: LOAD 0x12345678, x1 // load value at address into x1 

2: ADD x1, x1, x2 // add x1 to itself and put into x2

3: MUL x3, x3, x4 // multiply x3 with itself and put into x4
```

Here, instruction 2 is dependent on the result of instruction 1, but instruction 3 is independent of both 1 and 2.

Assume the following:
- LOADs have a latency of 20 cycles
- ADDs have a latency of 1 cycle
- MULs have a latency of 20 cycles

In an in-order pipelined processor, we would need to execute instructions 1-3 sequentially. Due to the inbalance between instructions 1 and 2, there is a severe performance penalty. Instruction 2 will sit in the decode stage for 20 cycles while the LOAD waits for its data. Instruction 3 will be stuck in fetch. This means the total execution time would be around 45 clock cycles.

An out-of-order processor would identify that MUL is independent of the LOAD. Thus, the MUL can execute before the add, in parallel with LOAD. Now, the the total execution time would be around 25 cycles.

The above calculations are approximate, but the conclusion is clear. Out-of-order processors can exploit instruction level parallelism, which can improve performance.

## What is Tomasulo's Algorithm (+ ROB)

Tomasulo's Algorithm is an algorithm for out-of-order execution. It allows the execution of instructions without data dependencies to be re-ordered. This is done using two structures:
- **Reservation Stations**: These contain all the information for an instruction's dependencies, operands, and any other metadata needed to execute the instruction.
- **Re-Order Buffer (ROB)**: This is a queue which keeps track of the order of instructions, and stores the destination and the data which will get written.

The ROB maintains something called **precise state**. Precise state is the idea that if your processor is stopped for any reason at any moment, the state of the register file and memory is the same as if the program were executed on an in-order processor. While your processor won't need to support interupts,  

Tomasulo's Algorithm does not directly support precise state. For our purposes, precise state means that the programmer (or OS) sees register/memory changes as if they were modified in order. In other words, if the programmer were to pause execution at any point in time, they should see a program & memory state identical to as if it was executed in order.

In order for Tomasulo's Algorithm to support precise state, an additional structure called a reorder buffer (ROB). The ROB holds the instructions in order and waits for instructions to finish executing. Once an instruction finishes executing and is the oldest instruction in the ROB, then it can commit, ensuring instructions commit from the ROB in order. When an instruction commits, the architectural register file is updated and stores have their values written to memory.

## Tomasulo's Algorithm Details

These are the key components of Tomasulo's Algorithm (+ Precise State) and when you will implement them during this MP:

- Fetch Logic [CP1 initially + CP3 when you work with the caches]
- Decoder [CP2]
- The ROB [CP2]
- The Reservation Stations [CP2]
- The Functional Units [CP2]
- The Common Data Bus (CDB) [CP2]
- The Register File [CP2]
- Load/Store Queues [CP3]
- Branch Resolution [CP3]

You can (and should) reuse logic from earlier MPs to implement the fetch logic, decode logic, functional units, and register file.

Below is a high-level overview of the Tomasulo architecture (taken from lecture). Many details are not shown. Furthermore, this diagram assumes only floating point instructions (which you do not need to support). You need to support out-of-order execution of the base RV32I ISA. Thus, it is imperative that you take the time to draw out a more detailed diagram during CP1 that more closely matches what you will be developing.

## Tomasulo's Algorithm Limitations

Tomasulo's Algorithm is not perfect, as it has a number of limitations that result in lower clock frequency, higher area, and higher power consumption. Here are a few:

- Register values are written twice: once to the ROB when an instruction finishes execution and once to the architectural register file once an instruction commits. This increases the energy consumption per instruction.
- Instruction values may come from either the ROB, the architectural register file, or the CDB. All of these structures are read at the same time. This complicates instruction dispatch and severely limits your clock frequency when you go superscaler. 

One solution to this is a more modern algorithm: Explicit Register Renaming, and reading data after issue.

## Parts of an Out-of-Order Pipeline

Below is a list of stages, their names, and what they do. We may say some of these words, and this is what they mean:

- **Fetch** - Fetches instructions
- **Decode** - Decodes instructions
- **Rename** - Maps an architectural register ID to a physical register ID.
- **Dispatch** - Moves an instruction from the in-order front-end to the out-of-order back-end. This involves allocating reservation stations and an ROB entry.
  - **Front-end** - The part of the processor that gets instructions and figures out what to do. Made up of multiple stages like Fetch, Decode, Rename, and Dispatch.
  - **Back-end** - The rest of the processor, which is responsible for executing the instructions and committing them.
- **Issue/Wakeup** - This stage keeps track of instruction dependencies, and *issues* (moves) instructions to the execution units when the dependencies are resolved.
- **Execute** - Executes an instruction.
- **Writeback/Resolution** - After execution, moves the result to the proper location and marks any dependencies as resolved. Tells the ROB that the instruction is finished.
- **Commit/Retire** - Modifies the architectural state of the processor. This is done by dequeueing ready entries in the ROB. At this point, an instruction is finished.

## Explicit Register Renaming & Read After Issue

The basic dataflow diagram of the back-end of a Tomasulo processor looks like this:

<p align="center">

</p>

A few things to note:

Rename/Dispatch gets the source operands from looking at the Architectural Register File, the ROB, and the CDB. If neither contain the up-to-date data, the source operand is marked "Not Ready".

The reservation station issues an instruction to the function unit only once it contains all of the data necessary for the instruction. Therefore, a given register's data can be stored in three places at once: The ROB, the Architectural Register File, and the Reservation station. This is wasteful!

Lets now look at a simple explicit-renaming merged-registerfile read-after-issue architecture:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/merged_v1.svg"/>
</p>

A few new structures popped up. Lets define what they are:

- **Physical Register File**\
  The basic idea is that we want to move all the data into once place. We don't want to waste space by storing the same register in three different places. Therefore, lets create that one place. To avoid storing this data inside the reservation station, lets also only read from this register file *after* issueing
  - **Physical vs Architectural Registers**\
    Architectural registers are the registers defined by an ISA. For example, RISC-V defines 32 general purpose registers.\
    A processor doesn't need to only contain 32 registers. In Tomasulo's algorithm, every ROB entry can also be used as a source operand for an instruction. Therefore, the total amount of *physical registers* is defined as the sum of all registers inside a processor that can store operands. In a Tomasulo processor, there are (32 + # ROB entries) physical registers.

- **RAT** - Register Alias Table.\
  The processor contains a bunch of physical registers. How do we know which physical register contains which architectural register's data? Here comes the RAT!

  The RAT contains 32 entries, one for each architectural register. Each entry stores two pieces of information: the mapped physical register index, and whether the physical register file contains the data.

- **RRF** - Retirement Register File.\
  This structure looks a lot like a RAT. The major difference is that it comes after the ROB, and is updated only when an instruction is committed/retires.

- **Free List**\
  The free list is simply a queue of physical register indices which do not store relevant data for any architectural register. It is used to rename destination registers.

Lets go through an example instruction executing in this pipeline: `addi x2, x1, 4`.

After an instruction is fetched and decoded:

- Cycle 0: Dispatch/Rename
  - Look at the *RAT* to see what physical register contains the data for `x1`. Let's say the RAT entry for `x1` is `1(valid) - p1`. This means that the correct data is currently inside physical register `p1`.
  - Look at the *Free List* for an unused physical register that we can use to store the output of this instruction. Let's say the register at the head of the free list is `p33`. We dequeue it.
  - We need to update RAT entry `x2` to point to the result of this instruction, so that future dependent instructions execute correctly. Let's set RAT entry `x2` to `0(invalid) - p33`.
  - Like a Tomasulo processor, we also need to enqueue ourselves to the *ROB*. Let's enqueue the following: `0(not ready to commit), p33(destination physical register), x2(destination architectural register)`. The ROB returns the index where this was enqueued. Let's say it returned `ROB0`
  - Now we have all of our information, let's put the renamed instruction inside a *reservation station*: `add, x2-->p33, p1(valid), imm(4) --> ROB0`.


- Cycle 1: Issue/Regfile Read
  - Look at the *reservation stations*. Since all the source operands are ready (`p1(valid)` and `imm(4)`), we can issue this instruction.
  - Read `p1` from the *physical register file* and send that data to the *function unit*.
  - Send `imm(4)` and all other metadata to the *function unit* from the *reservation station*.
  - Mark the *reservation station* as free.

- Cycle 2: Execute\
  This looks the same as a pipeline processor. Just execute. All the sources are here.

- Cycle 3: Writeback\
  Broadcast the result, the destination architectural register index, the destination physical register index, and the ROB entry index on the CDB. It looks like this: `ROB0, x2, p33, result`
  - Write `result` to the *physical register file* at index `p33`.
  - Set all *reservation stations* waiting for `p33` to ready. This is also called *wakeup*.
  - Mark the *RAT* entry at index `x2` as `valid` if it still maps to `p33`. 
  - Mark the ROB entry `ROB0` as ready-to-commit.

- Cycle 4: Commit\
  When the instruction is the head of the ROB, it will commit when it is marked as ready-to-commit. When it commits, it will:
  - Look at the current mapping inside *RRF* entry `x2`. Let's say it was `p2`. Since that architectural register is being updated, the old physical register mapping needs to be freed. Therefore, we need to enqueue `p2` onto the *free list*.
  - Set the *RRF* entry `x2` to map to the new destination: `p33`. 

You have just finished your first instruction! While this example doesn't cover every edge case, we hope it gives you a better understanding of what an out-of-order processor with explicit renaming looks like.
